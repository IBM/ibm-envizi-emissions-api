    "IBM Envizi - Emissions API calculates greenhouse gas emissions based on activities your organization performs. It uses a database of managed factors to calculate emissions. You can integrate emissions calculations into your applications and workflows, so that you can measure the carbon impact of everyday operations—like energy use, travel, refrigerants, and waste—and use that data to plan, forecast, and reduce emissions.\n",
