    "\n",
    "- **What**: The activity data - what type of activity generated emissions (e.g., electricity consumption, fuel combustion)\n",
    "- **Where**: The location data - where the activity took place (country, region, etc.)\n",
    "- **When**: The time data - when the activity occurred (date, time period)\n",

    "### Explaining the Payload Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time (When)**:\n",
    "   - `date`: The date when the electricity was consumed (January 4, 2025)\n",
    "   - This helps the API select the appropriate emissions factors for that time period\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Location (Where)**:\n",
    "   - `country`: The country where the electricity was consumed (USA)\n",
    "   - Location is crucial as emissions factors vary significantly by region due to different energy mixes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activity (What)**:\n",
    "   - `type`: The type of activity (electricity consumption)\n",
    "   - `value`: The amount of electricity consumed (10 kilowatt-hours)\n",
    "   - `unit`: The unit of measurement (kWh)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **includeDetails**:\n",
    "   - A boolean flag that determines whether the API response includes detailed calculation information\n",
    "   - Currently set to `false`, which will return only the final emissions value"

    "## Benefits of Including Details for Audit Purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "When `includeDetails` is set to `true`, the response includes critical information for audit purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculation Method**: Identifies whether location-based or market-based methods were used\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emission Factors**: Provides the specific factors used in the calculation, including:\n",
    "   - The numerical value of the factor\n",
    "   - The unit of measurement\n",
    "   - The source of the factor (e.g., EPA eGRID)\n",
    "   - The applicable region\n",
    "   - The year the factor was published\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculation Formula**: Shows exactly how the emissions value was derived\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Greenhouse Gas Breakdown**: Provides a breakdown of individual greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) that make up the total CO2e value\n",
    "\n",
    "This level of detail is essential for:\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance reporting\n",
    "- Third-party verification of emissions data\n",
    "- Internal audit processes\n",
    "- Transparency in sustainability reporting"
